        <h1>Travel to Turkey</h1>
        <p>Turkey has been a cradle for many cultures and civilizations. Anatolia, Byzantium, and the Ottoman Empire have all left their mark on the country.<em> Today, Turkey is home to numerous artifacts that offer a glimpse into the power and beauty of Asia Minor's past.</em> Ancient cities, majestic temples, towering minarets, and bustling bazaars await visitors.</p>

            <p>Istanbul is a repository of Orthodox and Muslim shrines, the ancient capital of the Byzantine Empire. Be sure to take a look at the famous Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, descend into the <strong>Basilica Cistern, climb the Galata Tower, and marvel at the rich decoration of the palaces of the Turkish sultans.</strong> You can finish your walk around Istanbul by riding a sea tram or just have a cup of the famous coffee with sweets in one of the cafes of the Old City.</p>

            <p>The ancient city of Ephesus, with its half-ruined Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, is another milestone in Turkish history. The easiest way to reach it is from Izmir.

 The ancient ruins of Tlos and Letoon (near Fethiye), Termessos (near Antalya), Priene, Didim, and Miletus (near Kusadasi) are closer to the resort towns. <strong><em>The best way to visit these sites is on a guided tour, which often includes</em> a visit to several historical sites.</strong><br>
     The ruins of Greek amphitheaters can be found in Miletus, Aspendos (near Antalya and Belek), Bodrum, Phaselis (near Kemer), and other regions of Turkey.

 It is recommended to purchase excursions from tour operators, as street vendors may not provide adequate service or qualified Russian-speaking guides, and they are not responsible for the safety of tourists.

            <li class="bew">Antalya Riviera</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/lava.png" alt="turkey" width="400">
            <p>While relaxing in the resorts of the Antalya Riviera, visit Alanya with its famous Kizil Kule tower and Damlatash caves, in Antalya go to the Duden waterfalls, in Kemer make a trip through the Goynuk canyon or to the mountain Takhtaly. In Belek go to the ruins of ancient Aspendos or Perge, in Side admire the columns of the temple of Apollo.</p>
            <li class="bew">The Aegean coast</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-and-lake.png" alt="turkey" width="400">
            <p>On the Aegean Sea resorts (in Bodrum, Fethiye, Kusadasi and Marmaris) you will not be bored either. It is worth seeing the famous Lycian tombs, excursions to which are available from all resorts, ancient Ephesus with the ruins of the Temple of Artemis. For fans of active recreation, we recommend looking at excursions on yachts and sea fishing.</p>
            <li class="bew">Pamukkale</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-sunset.png" alt="turkey" width="400">
            <p>One of the symbols of tourist Turkey is Pamukkale, with its snow-white travertines, healing thermal springs, Cleopatra's Pool, and the ancient Roman amphitheater. All tour operators and street agencies offer excursions to this destination. Prices start at around 65 euros. Swimming in Cleopatra's Pool is charged separately, with a ticket costing around 16 liras.</p>
            <li class="bew">Cappadocia</li>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/mountains-in-hawaii.png" alt="turkey" width="400">
            <p>Cappadocia is a land of the first Christian cave churches and bizarre rocks that resemble the surface of Mars. It is an extraordinary place that every tourist should see.<br>
                The best way to see them is to book a hot air balloon tour. Getting to Cappadocia is quite difficult, and the journey takes a lot of time and effort. Groups of tourists are usually transported by bus, while solo travelers prefer to use local airline flights or rent a car. In 2018, hot air balloon tours over Cappadocia started at around 100 euros per person. The cost depends on the ballooning company, the season, and the flight route.

Each resort has its own excursions, such as rafting, safaris, yachting, or Turkish nights with belly dancing. In Antalya, families can visit the water park, aquarium, and dolphinarium.
