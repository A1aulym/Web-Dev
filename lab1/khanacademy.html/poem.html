    <h1> Poems</h1>
    <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>
    <p> When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
And sable curls all silver’d o’er with white;<br>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves<br>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br>
And summer’s green all girded up in sheaves<br>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,</p>
